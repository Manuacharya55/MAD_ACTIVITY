          The Indian cricket team, governed by the Board of Control for Cricket
          in India (BCCI), represents India in international cricket.
          Established in 1926, the team plays in all three formats of the game:
          Test matches, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20
          Internationals (T20Is). The team is renowned for its strong fan base,
          rich cricketing history, and world-class players. Over the years,
          India has evolved into a cricketing powerhouse, consistently competing
          at the highest level on the global stage. In Test cricket, India is
          considered one of the strongest teams, especially at home. The team
          has produced some of the greatest cricketers, including Sunil
          Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and Anil Kumble.
          More recently, stars like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ravichandran
          Ashwin have continued the tradition of excellence. India won their
          first Test series on Australian soil in 2018-19 and has maintained a
          strong track record in Test championships.In the limited-overs
          formats, India’s success is equally remarkable. The Indian team won
          its first ODI World Cup in 1983 under the leadership of Kapil Dev,
          marking a historic moment in Indian sports. India later claimed the
          T20 World Cup in 2007 under MS Dhoni’s captaincy, and followed it up
          with another ODI World Cup win in 2011. The country has consistently
          produced top players in these formats, with Rohit Sharma holding the
          record for the highest individual score in ODIs (264 runs). India's
          cricket calendar is packed with international tournaments, including
          the ICC World Cup, Asia Cup, and various bilateral series against top
          cricketing nations. The Indian Premier League (IPL), the most popular
          T20 league globally, also plays a significant role in nurturing young
          Indian talent, which in turn strengthens the national team.
